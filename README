INTRODUCTION

A few scripts for turning a vanilla NCBI wwwblast installation into a link filled paradise.

blast_link was designed such that no patches to the wwwblast files are needed. Instead, it wraps around the server and parses the input and output using regular expressions. Thus, updating wwwblast is simple, and does not affect blast_link.

INSTALLATION

1. Git clone (or just download) blast_link into the directory wher you wish blast to reside e.g. "git clone git://github.com/wwood/blast_link.git /var/www/blast"
2. Download and extract a wwwblast installation from NCBI into the same directory ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/executables/LATEST/
3. Modify the subroutine at the top of blast_link_result.cgi so the links are to your liking.
4. Set up a webserver so that it serves blast correctly. For apache an example conf file is below
5. Point your browser to the blast_link.cgi, so possibly http://localhost/blast/blast_link.cgi

EXAMPLE APACHE CONFIG

AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .pl
Alias blast /var/www/blast
<Directory "/var/www/blast">
  Options FollowSymLinks +ExecCGI +Indexes
