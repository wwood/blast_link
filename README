INTRODUCTION

A few scripts for turning a vanilla NCBI wwwblast installation into a version that allows access to the full sequences of hits to query sequences. More generally, it allows arbitrary hyperlinks to be added blast result pages.

Blast_link was designed such that no patches to the wwwblast files are needed. Instead, it wraps around the server and parses the input and output using regular expressions. Thus, updating wwwblast is simple, and does not affect blast_link.

INSTALLATION

A comprehensive tutorial on using wwwblast and blast_link is maintained at http://openwetware.org/wiki/Blast_link
